The problem is : Computers use binary (base-2) to store numbers, while we often use decimal (base-10). Some decimal fractions, like 0.8, cannot be represented exactly as a finite fraction in binary.

##   IEEE 754 Floating-Point Representation of 0.8

###   The Challenge

   Computers use binary (base-2) to store numbers, while we often use decimal (base-10). Some decimal fractions, like 0.8, cannot be represented exactly as a finite fraction in binary. This is similar to how the fraction 1/3 cannot be represented as a finite decimal fraction (0.3333...).

###   IEEE 754 Standard

   The IEEE 754 standard defines how floating-point numbers are represented in computers. This standard ensures consistency across different systems. Let's examine how 0.8 is represented using this standard, focusing on the common 32-bit single-precision format.

###   32-bit Single-Precision Format

   The 32 bits are divided into three parts:

   * **Sign bit (1 bit):** Indicates whether the number is positive (0) or negative (1).

   * **Exponent (8 bits):** Represents the power of 2 by which the significand is multiplied.

   * **Significand (23 bits):** Represents the fractional part of the number.

###   Representation of 0.8

   Let's walk through the algorithm to represent 0.8 in IEEE 754 single-precision format:

   1.  **Sign Bit:**

       * Since the number is positive, the sign bit is 0.

   2.  **Exponent Part:**

       * To calculate the exponent part, we first convert the decimal fraction to binary by repeatedly multiplying the fractional part by 2 and recording the integer part:

           * 0.8 \* 2 = 1.6  => Integer part: 1

           * 0.6 \* 2 = 1.2  => Integer part: 1

           * 0.2 \* 2 = 0.4  => Integer part: 0

           * 0.4 \* 2 = 0.8  => Integer part: 0

           * 0.8 \* 2 = 1.6  => Integer part: 1 (repeats)

       * Therefore, 0.8 in binary is 0.110011001100... (repeating).

       * Next, we normalize the binary number by moving the decimal point to the left until there is only one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point:

           * 0.1100110011001100... = 1.100110011001100... \* 2^(-1)

       * The exponent is -1.

       * We then bias the exponent by adding 127 (for single-precision).  This allows us to represent both positive and negative exponents. The range 0-255 is used to represent the exponent.

       * Biased exponent = -1 + 127 = 126

       * Converting the biased exponent (126) to its 8-bit binary representation: 01111110

   3.  **Significand (Fractional Part):**

       * The significand is the fractional part of the normalized binary number.

       * From 1.100110011001100... \* 2^(-1), the fractional part is: 10011001100110011001100

       * The significand is 10011001100110011001100 (23 bits).

   4.  **Combining the Parts:**

       * Finally, we combine the sign bit, exponent, and significand:

           * Sign bit: 0

           * Exponent: 01111110

           * Significand: 10011001100110011001100

   The complete IEEE 754 single-precision representation of 0.8 is:

   **0 01111110 10011001100110011001100**
