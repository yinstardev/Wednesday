 $Q. \left\lfloor\sqrt{1}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\sqrt{2}\right\rfloor + .... + \left\lfloor\sqrt{2016}\right\rfloor$

Find the value of the above expression.


Obviously we know : 

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{x}\right\rfloor$ is : the value which less than nearest smaller square number.

for ex. $\left\lfloor\sqrt{27}\right\rfloor$ - nearest smaller square number is : 25 -> so the total value is 5.

Similarly we know all the values upto next square are same until we catch up there. 


$\left\lfloor\sqrt{1}\right\rfloor = 1$

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{2}\right\rfloor = 1$ 

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{3}\right\rfloor = 1$

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{4}\right\rfloor = 2$

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{5}\right\rfloor = 2$

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{6}\right\rfloor = 2$

...

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{8}\right\rfloor = 2$ 2 how many times -> obviously we notice pattern 2n + 1 times. 2 is 5 times.

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{9}\right\rfloor$
..

$\left\lfloor\sqrt{15}\right\rfloor$ 3 how many times -> 2n + 1 times that is : 7 times.

Similarly it will be same pattern followed up until the nearest smaller square number for 2016 which is 1936 - 44 squared.

So, we calculate the sum $\sum_{0}^{44}{2n + 1} - 44 * 6$
Subtracting last few numbers.
