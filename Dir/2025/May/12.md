Patterns in Prime's can't be Trusted. 

Let's get on with one example : $n^2 - n + 41$ 
Pull out any number below 41 into above expression and you will find the result is always prime number. 

Let's call these numbers interesting which exhibit this property. 

We will think this is quite interesting, but above 41, for the value of n in the above expression it doesn't follow up.

Then what about different value than 41, in $n^2 - n + x$ 
for some number x,

Seems we are in luck, we can find more numbers which follow the pattern that with above expression for certain values.

all the values below n below x, if you pull them up in the expression you will find them to be prime, 

Example is number 5, $n^2 - n + 5$, 
Now, if you put any number less than 5 in this expression. You will find it to be prime. 


But funny enough it only lasts upto 41, above 41 for the values of x, we don't find anything matching this same pattern.

There might be some number out there, but it will be computationally quite expensive.
